So apparently something that can just happen to cats is one of their pupils becomes significantly different in size from the other. If coupled with other symptoms like abnormal behavior, it can be an indication of something serious.

But mostly it's just weird and totally harmless. His pupils went back to normal within a few hours. Very strange, but kinda cool to see.
