[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a package manager for Mac, akin to APT on Ubuntu. I've personally know about it for a while but never explored it much. Turns out, there's a subcommand for brew called cask that lets you install popular GUI apps right from the CLI! It's amazing, I'm installing apps like Spotify and Firefox right from Terminal without going to any website or installer. I will do my best to never have to install an app from a website again.

Just wanted to post this to increase the amount of people praising this on the Internet.

Happy Brewing.
