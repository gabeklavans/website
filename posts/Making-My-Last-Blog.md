title: Making my Last Blog
---

#### Follow my (last) journey through all the components of a basic ([jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)) blog, or just go straight to [the guide](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/ "This Guy'd") that I ended up using

So my first post will be the process I went through to get this blog up and running.

I started with a simple "How to make a CS blog" google search. Initially I was shown the "3 main components" for running a blog: a web host, a domain, and the actual content (HTML/CSS/JS). The "web host" is just the server that the site will live on, and the content was suggested to be generated by [WordPress](https://wordpress.com "WordPress's Homepage"), an extremely popular open source blog-generating software.

Now I already knew of [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/ "Github Pages' Homepage") (GP) before this, and these guides were telling me to purchase server space from some web hosting provider like [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com "Digital Ocean's Homepage") or [BlueHost](https://www.bluehost.com "Bluehost's Homepage"). :money_with_wings: But GP is free! So what's the difference?

Github Pages just serves static pages. If I wanted any sort of interactivity with my site, I'd need a server running my website in real time. However, this is just a basic blog, no need for that. So, now I don't need to pay for web hosting.

The domain name would cost money, but I'm actually pretty ok with GP's default URL for now. It's just my name and an easy-to-remember suffix. Sweet, now I just need to generate some content.

WordPress has a plugin that allows you to generate static HTML, which I can then just push to my GP repo. But that still felt like a little too much, and it would prevent me from taking advantage of a lot of WordPress's cool features. A broader Google search then pointed me to Jekyll, a framework for generating static-blogging content. [This fairly comprehensive article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/ "A fairly comprehensive article about building a blog with Jekyll on GP") got me through the process of creating a Jekyll blog on GP with ***advanced*** ease. The author even made a [*fork-and-go* template](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now "Descriptive Title :open_mouth:"), the one I used to start this very blog. It can't get much easier.

In my Googling I also found [Disqus](https://disqus.com "Disqus' Homepage"), which is some sort of buff user-engagement service, but all I needed to know was that I could use it to add live commenting to my static blog.  
Do I need this?
